## MelonWM
A really bad wm that I made because why not.
Currently very WIP but I've been spending a lot of time on it recently.

#TO DO LIST (This will grow as I think of more things to do)
Add the option for command flags to seed
Have the default directory set as ~/.config/melon on both the wm and seed
