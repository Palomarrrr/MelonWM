# MelonWM
A really bad wm that I made because why not.
Currently very WIP but I've been spending a lot of time on it recently.
Theres definitely better ways to go about some thing I've done.

## Compiling
If for some reason you want to look at the wm, use the included Makefile. First type 
`$ make`
then as root
`# make install`
If you want to add the default configs to your .config directory type
`$ make config`

## TO DO LIST 
(This will grow as I think of more things to do)

Add the option for command flags to seed
Have the default directory set as ~/.config/melon on both the wm and seed
