# MelonWM
A really bad wm that I made because why not.
Currently very WIP but I've been spending a lot of time on it recently.
Theres definitely better ways to go about some thing I've done.

## Compiling
If for some reason you want to look at the wm, use the included Makefile. First type 
`$ make`
then as root
`# make install`
If you want to add the default configs to your .config directory type
`$ make config`
You can clean the local copies of the binary by typing 
`$ make clean`
And you can completely uninstall it by typing
`# make uninstall`
You can also test the wm in Xephyr by typing
`$ make test`

## TO DO LIST 
(This will grow as I think of more things to do)

* MAKE THIS THING EWMH COMPLIANT SO I CAN ADD MORE THINGS 
* moving windows around / resizing windows with the keyboard??
* tiling feature
* COMMENT THINGS BETTER

## Projects that helped me when I was lost
I've been needing to add this because I've felt like shit not giving them some kind of credit.
These projects have helped me understand X11 a little better and have helped point me in the right direction sometimes.
Go check them out because theyre all pretty cool in my opinion.
